# Liberty Café Dashboard


## Project Overview

The Liberty Café Dashboard is an interactive Excel-based dashboard created to analyze and optimize the performance of a fictional coffee shop, Liberty Café. This project helps in tracking important Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, footfall, and customer behavior across different time periods and store locations. It provides visual insights into business performance to aid in data-driven decision-making.

## Objective

The primary objective of the Liberty Café dashboard is to provide a comprehensive, data-driven view of the café’s sales performance, customer behavior, and product preferences. By leveraging interactive visualizations, the goal is to enable café managers to make informed decisions to enhance profitability, streamline operations, and improve customer satisfaction across multiple locations.

## Problem Statement

Liberty Café, an expanding chain with three locations across New York City, has been facing challenges in efficiently managing its operations and understanding customer preferences. The café management team is finding it difficult to identify key growth opportunities, understand peak business hours, and determine the profitability of different product categories. Additionally, the café lacks insights into store-level performance, seasonal trends, and optimal resource allocation. This has resulted in missed opportunities to boost revenue, optimize menu offerings, and improve the customer experience.

## Tools Used

Microsoft Excel (for data analysis and dashboard creation)
Pivot Tables and Charts
Slicers for data filtering
Combo charts and other visualization tools


## Conclusion
The Liberty Café dashboard offers valuable insights into sales performance and customer behavior. It highlights opportunities to optimize staffing during peak hours, promote larger-sized drinks, and focus on the most popular product categories (Coffee and Tea). The even distribution of sales across all locations suggests consistent performance, but further analysis of store-specific strategies could help boost underperforming months.
